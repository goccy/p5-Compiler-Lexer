=head1 NAME

podcheck.t - Look for possible problems in the Perl pods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 cd t
 ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t [--show_all] [--cpan] [--deltas]
                                                  [--counts] [ FILE ...]
 ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --add_link MODULE ...

 ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --regen

=head1 DESCRIPTION

podcheck.t is an extension of Pod::Checker.  It looks for pod errors and
potential errors in the files given as arguments, or if none specified, in all
pods in the distribution workspace, except certain known special ones
(specified below).  It does additional checking beyond that done by
Pod::Checker, and keeps a database of known potential problems, and will
fail a pod only if the number of such problems differs from that given in the
database.  It also suppresses the C<(section) deprecated> message from
Pod::Checker, since specifying the man page section number is quite proper to do.

The additional checks it makes are:

=over

=item Cross-pod link checking

Pod::Checker verifies that links to an internal target in a pod are not
broken.  podcheck.t extends that (when called without FILE arguments) to
external links.  It does this by gathering up all the possible targets in the
workspace, and cross-checking them.  It also checks that a non-broken link
points to just one target.  (The destination pod could have two targets with
the same name.)

The way that the C<LE<lt>E<gt>> pod command works (for links outside the pod)
is to actually create a link to C<search.cpan.org> with an embedded query for
the desired pod or man page.  That means that links outside the distribution
are valid.  podcheck.t doesn't verify the validity of such links, but instead
keeps a data base of those known to be valid.  This means that if a link to a
target not on the list is created, the target needs to be added to the data
base.  This is accomplished via the L<--add_link|/--add_link MODULE ...>
option to podcheck.t, described below.

=item An internal link that isn't so specified

If a link is broken, but there is an existing internal target of the same
name, it is likely that the internal target was meant, and the C<"/"> is
missing from the C<LE<lt>E<gt>> pod command.

=item Verbatim paragraphs that wrap in an 80 (including 1 spare) column window

It's annoying to have lines wrap when displaying pod documentation in a
terminal window.  This checks that all verbatim lines fit in a standard 80
column window, even when using a pager that reserves a column for its own use.
(Thus the check is for a net of 79 columns.)
For those lines that don't fit, it tells you how much needs to be cut in
order to fit.

Often, the easiest thing to do to gain space for these is to lower the indent
to just one space.

=item Missing or duplicate NAME or missing NAME short description

A pod can't be linked to unless it has a unique name.
And a NAME should have a dash and short description after it.

=item =encoding statement issues

This indicates if an C<=encoding> statement should be present, or moved to the
front of the pod.

=item Items that perhaps should be links

There are mentions of apparent files in the pods that perhaps should be links
instead, using C<LE<lt>...E<gt>>

=item Items that perhaps should be C<FE<lt>...E<gt>>

What look like path names enclosed in C<CE<lt>...E<gt>> should perhaps have
C<FE<lt>...E<gt>> mark-up instead.

=back

A number of issues raised by podcheck.t and by the base Pod::Checker are not
really problems, but merely potential problems, that is, false positives.
After inspecting them and
deciding that they aren't real problems, it is possible to shut up this program
about them, unlike base Pod::Checker.  For a valid link to an outside module
or man page, call podcheck.t with the C<--add_link> option to add it to the
the database of known links; for other causes, call podcheck.t with the C<--regen>
option to regenerate the entire database.  This tells it that all existing
issues are to not be mentioned again.

C<--regen> isn't fool-proof.  The database merely keeps track of the number of these
potential problems of each type for each pod.  If a new problem of a given
type is introduced into the pod, podcheck.t will spit out all of them.  You
then have to figure out which is the new one, and should it be changed or not.
But doing it this way insulates the database from having to keep track of line
numbers of problems, which may change, or the exact wording of each problem
which might also change without affecting whether it is a problem or not.

Also, if the count of potential problems of a given type for a pod decreases,
the database must be regenerated so that it knows the new number.  The program
gives instructions when this happens.

Some pods will have varying numbers of problems of a given type.  This can
be handled by manually editing the database file (see L</FILES>), and setting
the number of those problems for that pod to a negative number.  This will
cause the corresponding error to always be suppressed no matter how many there
actually are.

Another problem is that there is currently no check that modules listed as
valid in the data base
actually are.  Thus any errors introduced there will remain there.

=head2 Specially handled pods

=over

=item perltoc

This pod is generated by pasting bits from other pods.  Errors in those bits
will show up as errors here, as well as for those other pods.  Therefore
errors here are suppressed, and the pod is checked only to verify that nodes
within it actually exist that are externally linked to.

=item perldelta

The current perldelta pod is initialized from a template that contains
placeholder text.  Some of this text is in the form of links that don't really
exist.  Any such links that are listed in C<@perldelta_ignore_links> will not
generate messages.  It is presumed that these links will be cleaned up when
the perldelta is cleaned up for release since they should be marked with
C<XXX>.

=item Porting/perldelta_template.pod

This is not a pod, but a template for C<perldelta>.  Any errors introduced
here will show up when C<perldelta> is created from it.

=item cpan-upstream pods

See the L</--cpan> option documentation

=item old perldeltas

See the L</--deltas> option documentation

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --add_link MODULE ...

Use this option to teach podcheck.t that the C<MODULE>s or man pages actually
exist, and to silence any messages that links to them are broken.

podcheck.t checks that links within the Perl core distribution are valid, but
it doesn't check links to man pages or external modules.  When it finds
a broken link, it checks its data base of external modules and man pages,
and only if not found there does it raise a message.  This option just adds
the list of modules and man page references that follow it on the command line
to that data base.

For example,

    cd t
    ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --add_link Unicode::Casing

causes the external module "Unicode::Casing" to be added to the data base, so
C<LE<lt>Unicode::CasingE<gt>> will be considered valid.

=item --regen

Regenerate the data base used by podcheck.t to include all the existing
potential problems.  Future runs of the program will not then flag any of
these.

=item --cpan

Normally, all pods in the cpan directory are skipped, except to make sure that
any blead-upstream links to such pods are valid.
This option will cause cpan upstream pods to be fully checked.

=item --deltas

Normally, all old perldelta pods are skipped, except to make sure that
any links to such pods are valid.  This is because they are considered
stable, and perhaps trying to fix them will cause changes that will
misrepresent Perl's history.  But, this option will cause them to be fully
checked.

=item --show_all

Normally, if the number of potential problems of a given type found for a
pod matches the expected value in the database, they will not be displayed.
This option forces the database to be ignored during the run, so all potential
problems are displayed and will fail their respective pod test.  Specifying
any particular FILES to operate on automatically selects this option.

=item --counts

Instead of testing, this just dumps the counts of the occurrences of the
various types of potential problems in the data base.

#####################################################
# HOW IT WORKS (in general)
#
# If not called with specific files to check, the directory structure is
# examined for files that have pods in them.  Files that might not have to be
# fully parsed (e.g. in cpan) are parsed enough at this time to find their
# pod's NAME, and to get a checksum.
#
# Those kinds of files are sorted last, but otherwise the pods are parsed with
# the package coded here, My::Pod::Checker, which is an extension to
# Pod::Checker that adds some tests and suppresses others that aren't
# appropriate.  The latter module has no provision for capturing diagnostics,
# so a package, Tie_Array_to_FH, is used to force them to be placed into an
# array instead of printed.
#
# Parsing the files builds up a list of links.  The files are gone through
# again, doing cross-link checking and outputting all saved-up problems with
# each pod.
#
# Sorting the files last that potentially don't need to be fully parsed allows
# us to not parse them unless there is a link to an internal anchor in them
# from something that we have already parsed.  Keeping checksums allows us to
# not parse copies of other pods.

HOW TO GET THIS .t TO PASS

There $were_count_files that had new potential problems identified.
Some of them may be real, and some of them may be false positives because
this program isn't as smart as it likes to think it is.  You can teach this
program to ignore the issues it has identified, and hence pass, by doing the
following:

1) If a problem is about a link to an unknown module or man page that
   you know exists, re-run the command something like:
      ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --add_link MODULE man_page ...
   (MODULEs should look like Foo::Bar, and man_pages should look like
   bar(3c); don't do this for a module or man page that you aren't sure
   about; instead treat as another type of issue and follow the
   instructions below.)

2) For other issues, decide if each should be fixed now or not.  Fix the
   ones you decided to, and rerun this test to verify that the fixes
   worked.

3) If there remain false positive or problems that you don't plan to fix right
   now,
$how_to
   That should cause all current potential problems to be accepted by
   the program, so that the next time it runs, they won't be flagged.

    if (%files_with_fixes) {
        $message .= "   This step will also take care of the files that have fixes in them\n";
    }

    $message .= <<EOF;
   For a few files, such as perltoc, certain issues will always be
   expected, and more of the same will be added over time.  For those,
   before you do the regen, you can edit
   $known_issues
   and find the entry for the module's file and specific error message,
   and change the count of known potential problems to -1.

HOW TO GET THIS .t TO PASS

There $were_count_files that had new potential problems identified.
Some of them may be real, and some of them may be false positives because
this program isn\'t as smart as it likes to think it is.  You can teach this
program to ignore the issues it has identified, and hence pass, by doing the
following:

1) If a problem is about a link to an unknown module or man page that
   you know exists, re-run the command something like:
      ./perl -I../lib porting/podcheck.t --add_link MODULE man_page ...
   (MODULEs should look like Foo::Bar, and man_pages should look like
   bar(3c); don\'t do this for a module or man page that you aren\'t sure
   about; instead treat as another type of issue and follow the
   instructions below.)

2) For other issues, decide if each should be fixed now or not.  Fix the
   ones you decided to, and rerun this test to verify that the fixes
   worked.

3) If there remain false positive or problems that you don\'t plan to fix right
   now,
$how_to
   That should cause all current potential problems to be accepted by
   the program, so that the next time it runs, they won\'t be flagged.

program to ignore the issues it has identified, and hence pass, by doing the
following:

1) If a problem is about a link to an unknown module or man page that
   you know exists, re-run the command something like:

   (MODULEs should look like Foo::Bar, and man_pages should look like
   bar(3c); don\'t do this for a module or man page that you aren\'t sure
   about; instead treat as another type of issue and follow the
   instructions below.)

2) For other issues, decide if each should be fixed now or not.  Fix the
   ones you decided to, and rerun this test to verify that the fixes
   worked.

3) If there remain false positive or problems that you don\'t plan to fix right
